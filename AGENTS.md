# Agents Rules

## Workspace Structure

This workspace is organized for knowledge management around an evolving
project.

Knowledge layer files (workspace root):

* `STATE.md` (always present) -- Current operational state. What is in
  flight, what is unresolved, what comes next. Sections are rewritten
  as understanding matures, never merely appended to. Touched every
  session that produces operational findings.
* `IDENTITY.md` (optional; introduced for larger / longer-lived
  projects) -- What the project IS. Purpose, architectural
  commitments, posture, non-negotiables. Slow-changing.
* `VISION.md` (optional; introduced for larger / longer-lived
  projects) -- Where the project is HEADING. Long-term capabilities,
  reframes, moon shots, what the substrate or design enables that has
  not yet been built. Updated occasionally.

Working material:

* `_working/` -- Messy exploration files, chat dumps, in-progress
  notes, session summaries, handoffs for future agents. Raw material,
  not reference. May be redundant, contradictory, or stale. Primary
  function: preserve knowledge across short-lived agent sessions, so
  it never lives only inside one chat. Err on the side of dumping --
  lost knowledge is more expensive than a messy file.
* `_working/INDEX.md` -- Keyword index of all working files. This is
  how you find relevant working files without reading all of them.
  See "Working file hygiene".
* `_archive/` -- Working files whose insights have been fully absorbed
  into the knowledge layer, plus raw source material (e.g. full
  meeting transcripts) that backs the summaries in `_working/`. You
  may read files from `_archive/` if you need original source detail
  that a summary does not cover. Files are moved here by the user
  after an agent surfaces a list of fully-absorbed working files (see
  "When asked to consolidate"); agents do not move files into
  `_archive/` themselves.

Project context:

* `.cursor/rules/` -- Persistent AI context that loads into every
  chat.
* `README.md` -- If the workspace was started from the AI workspace
  template, the initial `README.md` is the template's setup
  documentation, not project content. Ignore it during normal
  operation. If it still exists and the project already has a
  `STATE.md`, suggest to the user that it can be deleted (its banner
  near the top says the same). Once it is deleted, a future
  `README.md` is project content like any other file.

Implementation directories (project-specific) sit alongside the
knowledge layer at the root. Project layout, build / run / test
commands, and key conventions live in `STATE.md` or `IDENTITY.md`
(when the latter exists). If you find a project with substantial
implementation but no orientation pointers in either file, add a
brief `## Layout` section to `STATE.md` -- a few lines naming each
directory and its run command is plenty.

## Knowledge Layer Tiers

### What goes where

* `STATE.md` is for what is HAPPENING now. Hot list, in-flight work,
  open questions, action items, freshly-pinned decisions whose
  rationale is still being absorbed. Operational. Updated every
  session.
* `IDENTITY.md` is for what the project IS. The mental model and
  worldview. Architectural commitments. Conventions. Constraints
  that cannot be renegotiated cheaply. The "no, you cannot do
  that" rules that guard against shortcuts. Updated when the
  worldview shifts (rare); treated as a deliberate act, not a
  side-effect of feature work.
* `VISION.md` is for where the project is HEADING. Long-term
  capabilities, reframes, moon shots, ambitions worth preserving
  so they do not get lost in day-to-day work. Updated when
  reflection or brainstorming produces durable new ambitions.
  Occasional.

When a finding is clean enough for the curated layer, decide which
tier. Will it still be valid in three months? If yes (binding rule,
stable architecture decision, posture commitment) -> `IDENTITY.md`.
If it is something you want to be true at some future point ->
`VISION.md`. Otherwise -> `STATE.md`. (This is a routing test among
curated tiers, not a gate on whether to capture at all -- findings
that are not yet curated-layer-ready go to `_working/` regardless of
how durable they are.)

### When to introduce them

* `IDENTITY.md`: when a Purpose section or Design Summary section in
  `STATE.md` has been substantially stable for weeks and you find
  yourself re-explaining its content rather than evolving it. Lift
  those sections out of `STATE.md` into `IDENTITY.md` and replace
  with a short cross-reference.
* `VISION.md`: when a brainstorm session or reflection produces
  long-term ambitions that you want to preserve as orientation
  without driving immediate work. The brainstorm itself can stay in
  `_working/` while the durable distillation moves to `VISION.md`.

If a project has `IDENTITY.md` but no `VISION.md`, that is fine. If a
project has `VISION.md` but no `IDENTITY.md`, that is a smell --
vision without grounded identity tends to drift. Add `IDENTITY.md`
first.

### Cross-references

Each knowledge layer file should open with a short preamble pointing
at the others (whichever exist), so a reader landing on any one of
them can find the rest. The shape:

* `STATE.md` opens by pointing at `IDENTITY.md` (for what the
  project is) and `VISION.md` (for where it is heading) and any
  canonical design doc in `_working/`.
* `IDENTITY.md` opens by pointing at `VISION.md` and `STATE.md`.
* `VISION.md` opens by pointing at `IDENTITY.md` and `STATE.md`.

### Reading order for context priming

When starting a session:

1. Read `STATE.md`. The hot list is the most informative thing in
   the workspace.
2. Read `IDENTITY.md` when the task touches architectural decisions,
   when contemplating a shortcut, when reorienting after a long
   break, or when uncertain whether a proposed change matches the
   project's worldview.
3. Read `VISION.md` when doing big-picture work, prioritisation,
   reflection, or when asked to think about direction.

Do not read all three on every trivial task. Read the cheapest
sufficient subset.

## Rules for AI Assistants

Your primary job in this workspace is to keep knowledge from getting
lost across short-lived agent sessions. Two operational forms:

* Maintain the curated layer (`STATE.md`, plus `IDENTITY.md` and
  `VISION.md` when they exist) as a reliable, current set of
  references.
* Capture session-bound knowledge into `_working/` -- summaries,
  handoffs, partial findings -- so understanding persists when the
  chat ends.

The curated layer is the project's reference state; working files
are the persistence mechanism that prevents knowledge loss between
agents. Treat both as continuous responsibilities, not periodic
cleanup tasks.

`IDENTITY.md` and `VISION.md` exist only when the project has earned
them; do not create them eagerly. When they exist, route findings to
whichever file's role they fit (see "What goes where" above).

### Markdown files

When writing Markdown files, default to these rules:

* Use one or more leading `#` for sections, not the alternative style
  with separate underlining.
* Use `---` horizontal lines where they make sense.
* Prefer `*` for unordered lists over `-`. Nested lists inside
  ordered or checkbox lists may use `-` to keep the hierarchy
  visible.
* Do not use text styles like bold or italic.
* Do not use non-ASCII characters like em-dash, arrow glyphs, etc.
  Use ASCII representations like `-`, `--`, `->`, `<->`.
* No Unicode glyphs outside ASCII, except when quoting text that uses
  them.
* If both list (bullet points) and tables are equally suitable,
  prefer a list.

### Reporting test status

Report green/red, not counts. "532 tests passed" goes stale and is
ambiguous (full suite or subset?); "full suite green".
When a count IS informative, name what it counts
("12 new idempotency tests added; suite green"). Applies to commits,
knowledge layer files, and handoff working files.

### When producing findings or insights

* When a finding is clean and operational, update `STATE.md`
  directly. If the topic already has a section, rewrite that section.
  If it is a new aspect, add a section.
* If the finding is binding worldview / posture / architectural
  commitment (and `IDENTITY.md` exists), route there instead. If
  `IDENTITY.md` does not exist but the finding clearly belongs there,
  add it to `STATE.md` and flag that this is a candidate for an
  eventual `IDENTITY.md` lift.
* If the finding is long-term ambition / reframe / moon shot (and
  `VISION.md` exists), route there. Otherwise, drop a working doc in
  `_working/`; vision-shaped material benefits from staging in
  working files until it stabilises.
* A finding may have multiple aspects (operational + architectural,
  or near-term + long-term). Split it across tiers and cross-
  reference rather than forcing the whole thing into one home.
* Use a `_working/` file when the finding is preliminary (still
  exploring, conclusion might change), when it is a session summary
  or handoff for future agents, when it captures context another
  agent should not have to rediscover, or when you need a staging
  area before synthesis.
* When in doubt, drop a working file. Working files exist primarily
  to preserve knowledge across short-lived agent sessions -- lost
  knowledge is more expensive than a messy file.
* Whenever you create a file (in `_working/` or anywhere else), name
  the file in your reply and summarise its contents in a sentence or
  two so the user knows it exists. Never silently create files
  outside `_working/` without confirming.

### When updating knowledge layer files

* Rewrite the relevant section to reflect current understanding. Do
  not append "update:" blocks or changelog entries -- the document
  should always read as a clean current-state description.
* Preserve sections unrelated to the current task verbatim.
* If a new aspect has emerged that deserves its own section, add it
  and suggest where it fits in the document's structure.
* Freshness markers. Two conventions, depending on the file:
  - `STATE.md` uses per-section markers
    (`## Technical Status (updated YYYY-MM-DD)`) because its sections
    are rewritten independently. Update the marker on sections you
    actually rewrite; leave others as-is.
  - `IDENTITY.md` and `VISION.md` use a single top-level marker on
    the document title (`# Title (updated YYYY-MM-DD)`) because the
    worldview and ambitions tend to evolve as a whole. Bump the
    top-level marker on any substantive edit.
  - Working files do not need freshness markers; their dated
    filename is the freshness signal.

`STATE.md`-specific rule:

* Hot list. `STATE.md` starts with a `## Hot List` section
  immediately after any preamble. This is a short (max 5 bullet
  points) summary of the most important facts and priorities right
  now. Bullets should be terse -- one or two lines each, a headline
  plus pointers (to action items, design docs, working files), not
  full status paragraphs. If a bullet keeps growing, content has
  crept in from another section; lift the detail to its proper home
  and leave a pointer. Every time you update any section of
  `STATE.md`, also re-examine the hot list and rewrite it if the
  update changes what matters most. The hot list must always be
  current -- it is the first thing a reader (human or AI) sees. If
  the hot list keeps growing past 5 bullets, the cause is usually
  that architectural identity is bleeding into operational state;
  that is a signal to introduce `IDENTITY.md` and lift the
  architectural content out.

### Session-end handoff

When a session is wrapping up -- the user signals they are done, the
context window is filling, or the work has produced findings without
landing in the curated layer -- drop a working file summarising what
was learned, what is still open, and where the next agent should pick
up. Frame it as a handoff. Add an `INDEX.md` entry like any other
working file. This is the operational form of the "preserve knowledge
across sessions" responsibility from the preamble; do it without
being asked when the conditions hit.

### When asked to consolidate

When the user asks to consolidate, fold in, merge, promote, or
otherwise move working-file content into the knowledge layer -- in
any phrasing -- do the following:

1. Read the specified working files and the relevant knowledge layer
   files.
2. Identify which insights from the working files are not yet
   captured in the knowledge layer.
3. Route each insight to its correct tier:
   - Operational, in-flight, soon-to-change -> `STATE.md`.
   - Stable architectural commitment, posture, worldview -> `IDENTITY.md`
     (or stage in `STATE.md` if `IDENTITY.md` does not exist yet, and
     suggest the lift).
   - Long-term ambition, reframe, moon shot -> `VISION.md` (or stage
     in `_working/` if `VISION.md` does not exist yet, and suggest
     the lift).
4. Rewrite the affected sections incorporating those insights.
5. Re-examine the `STATE.md` hot list and rewrite it if the
   consolidated insights change what matters most.
6. List which working files are now fully absorbed and can be moved
   to `_archive/`. The user typically performs the move.
7. After files are moved (in the same session or a later one), remove
   their entries from `_working/INDEX.md`. The index lists only files
   currently in `_working/`.
8. Flag any files that are only partially absorbed (some aspects
   still in progress, or only some sections promoted to a higher
   tier). Partially absorbed files stay in `_working/` until fully
   absorbed.

### Working file hygiene

Reading working files:

* To find relevant working files, read `_working/INDEX.md`. It
  contains keywords for every working file. Use it to decide which
  files to open -- do not read all working files to "build context".
* Do not treat working files as authoritative. If they conflict with
  the knowledge layer, the knowledge layer wins unless the user says
  otherwise.

Creating and updating working files:

* Use descriptive names with date prefix:
  `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`.
* Every time you create or substantially update a working file, you
  must also update its entry in `_working/INDEX.md`. This is not
  optional -- the index is how future agents find relevant material.
  A file without an index entry is invisible.
* When a working file is moved to `_archive/`, remove its entry from
  `INDEX.md`. The index should only list files that are currently in
  `_working/`.
* The entry format is:

```
## <filename>
<keywords, separated by commas -- aim for 10-20 per file, covering the
main topics, names, technical terms, and concepts in the file>
```

### When asked to commit

When the user asks to commit, push, or otherwise capture changes in
git -- in any phrasing -- two rules apply on top of the system's
standard git commit guidance:

* Commit only your own scope. Stage only files YOU edited or
  created in this session, tracked from your own tool-call history.
  Other agents or background tools may have modified files
  concurrently; those are out of scope and stay unstaged. Never use
  `git add .`, `git add -A`, or `git commit -a` -- they sweep up
  out-of-scope changes. If `git status` shows changes you did not
  make, name them in your reply (so the user knows they are still
  pending) but leave them alone. If you cannot reconstruct your
  scope confidently, ask; do not guess from the diff.

* Chain related git commands into single shell calls.
  - Pre-flight inspection: one call
    (`git status; git diff -- <files>; git log --oneline -10`).
  - Commit: one call
    (`git add <files> && git commit -m ... && git status`).
  Keeping the commit as one atomic shell call makes it reviewable
  as a unit and avoids the per-call approval friction some setups
  have.

### Proactive suggestions

* If you notice the user has explored an aspect across multiple
  working files and the understanding seems stable, suggest
  consolidating into the knowledge layer.
* If a knowledge layer section looks stale relative to recent chat
  findings, mention it. If you are working in an area covered by a
  section whose freshness date is old, say so even if the user did
  not ask.
* If your own analysis or evidence from code contradicts something in
  the knowledge layer, say so explicitly and quote the specific
  passage that conflicts, so the user can compare without hunting.
  The knowledge layer is authoritative over working files, but it is
  not infallible -- flag the contradiction and let the user decide.
* When creating a working file that covers ground already in the
  knowledge layer, say which sections overlap and whether the working
  file adds anything beyond what is already captured. This prevents
  working files from silently accumulating redundant material.
* If `STATE.md` is consistently exceeding the 5-bullet hot list rule
  because architectural content keeps showing up there, suggest
  introducing `IDENTITY.md` and lifting that content out.
* If brainstorm-shaped content keeps accumulating across working
  files without an obvious home, suggest introducing `VISION.md`.

### Auditing knowledge layer files

When the user asks to check, audit, or review the knowledge layer
for staleness, contradictions, drift, or accuracy -- in any
phrasing, including indirect prompts like "is this still right?",
"anything outdated here?", or "does this match the code?" -- do the
following:

* Read the specified file(s) in full and check each section for
  internal consistency -- do any sections make claims that contradict
  other sections?
* Check freshness dates. Flag any section that has not been updated
  in a long time, especially if the underlying topic is fast-moving.
* If codebase references are present, spot-check whether key file
  paths, class names, or symbols mentioned still exist in the code.
* For `STATE.md`: check whether the hot list still reflects the most
  important priorities, or whether it has drifted from what the
  sections actually say.
* For `IDENTITY.md`: check whether any section has accumulated
  operational content that should be in `STATE.md`, and whether any
  commitments have been silently violated by recent work.
* For `VISION.md`: check whether any of the long-term ambitions have
  drifted into the active roadmap (promote to `STATE.md` action
  items if so), and whether the cross-references to `IDENTITY.md`
  commitments still hold.
* Report what you find. Do not silently rewrite -- present the
  issues and let the user decide what to update.

### Bootstrapping

If `STATE.md` does not exist, read and follow
`.cursor/skills/bootstrap-workspace/SKILL.md`.

Do not add bootstrap skills for `IDENTITY.md` or `VISION.md`. They
are introduced manually as the project earns them; see "When to
introduce them" above.
