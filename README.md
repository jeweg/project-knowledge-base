# AI Project Template

A template for AI-assisted projects: a curated knowledge layer that
survives across chats. Copy this folder to start a new project workspace.

> Setup documentation. Once your `STATE.md` has been bootstrapped and you no
> longer need to refer to this file, delete it -- it is template scaffolding,
> not project content. The rest of this README explains the structure and how
> to work with it; the bootstrap skill will offer to delete this file once
> setup completes.

Developed and used in Cursor; designed to also work with Claude Code, OpenAI
Codex CLI, and any other agent tool that reads `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` at
the workspace root (most modern ones do). Only Cursor is verified at present.
See "Tool compatibility" under Design Principles for adapting to a tool that
does not.

## The Problem This Solves

When working with AI on longer efforts -- code analysis, debugging, design
exploration, research -- understanding accumulates in chat sessions and scattered
markdown files. Chats may hit context limits and get abandoned. Files become redundant
or contradictory as understanding evolves. You lose the overview, feel the urge to
start from scratch, but are afraid of losing buried insights.

This template provides a structure that separates raw exploration from curated
understanding, so you can work messily without losing clarity.

TL;DR: copy this folder, open an AI chat, and tell the agent what you want
to work on. That's it. The first agent will likely offer to bootstrap `STATE.md`
and ask what it needs to know; the structure described below grows from
there. You can stop reading at this point and still use the template
competently -- the rest of this README is for when you want to understand
the design.


## Core Concepts

There are two kinds of material in this workspace:

* Working files (`_working/`) -- the messy, temporal record of exploration.
  Chat dumps, notes, half-formed ideas, dead ends, session summaries, handoffs
  for future agents. These are expected to be redundant, contradictory, and
  incomplete. They are raw material. Their primary function is preserving
  knowledge across short-lived agent sessions; err on the side of dumping --
  lost knowledge costs more than a messy file. See "Knowledge persistence
  across sessions" under Design Principles for the rationale.

* The state document (`STATE.md`) -- your single, clean, current-state summary.
  This is what you would hand someone to get them up to speed. It is rewritten
  as understanding matures, not appended to. Stale information is overwritten,
  not preserved alongside new information. It always starts with a "Hot List"
  (max 5 bullets, each terse -- a headline plus pointers, not a status
  paragraph) of the most important facts and priorities right now, and each
  section heading carries a freshness marker like `(updated 2026-04-01)`.

The key discipline: working files flow into STATE.md when an aspect crystallizes,
and then they get archived. STATE.md is never a log -- it is always a snapshot of
"what I know right now." The Hot List at the top is the fastest way to re-orient
after a break.

For larger or longer-lived projects, the curated layer can extend with two
optional documents -- `IDENTITY.md` (what the project IS) and `VISION.md` (where
it is HEADING). They are introduced manually when a project earns them, not by
default. See "Beyond STATE.md" below.


## Setting Up a New Workspace

1. Copy this template folder to a new location.
2. Open it in your editor (Cursor, VS Code, or similar).
3. If this workspace analyzes an external codebase, note the paths and mention
   them when you tell the AI about the project in step 4 -- they will go into
   STATE.md.
4. Start a chat. The AI will notice that STATE.md does not exist and offer to
   create one based on what you tell it about the project. The initial STATE.md
   will include a Hot List, a Purpose section, Open Questions, and Action Items
   as a minimum skeleton.
5. Delete this file (`README.md`). It is only needed during setup. (GitHub
   conventions made `README.md` the right name for the template repo's
   landing page; once you have copied the template into a project, the
   file's job is done.)


## Day-to-Day Workflow

Work in chats as usual. The agent updates STATE.md directly with clean
operational findings and drops a dated `_working/` file (e.g.
`2026-03-09-memory-layout-notes.md`) for preliminary or session-handoff
material. Most of this happens without direction; the prompts below are for
when you want to drive something specific.

* "consolidate these working files into STATE.md" (name them, or say
  "everything about topic X") -- the agent rewrites affected sections and
  tells you which files are now fully absorbed.
* "audit state" (or "audit identity" / "audit vision") -- the agent checks
  for contradictions, stale freshness dates, dead references, and whether
  the Hot List still matches reality. It reports without silently rewriting.
* "wrap up the session" or "write a handoff" -- the agent dumps findings and
  open questions to a `_working/` file before context runs out. Agents are
  supposed to do this proactively when context is filling; ask if a session
  ends without one and you noticed.

When the urge hits to reorganize from scratch, resist copying everything into
a new folder. Instead, rewrite the stale STATE.md sections, archive the
working files that fed them, and leave in-progress aspects untouched. Same
psychological reset, no information loss.


## Beyond STATE.md: Identity and Vision

Most projects are well-served by `STATE.md` alone. As a project grows and its
worldview stabilises, two more curated documents become useful at the workspace
root:

* `IDENTITY.md` -- what the project IS. Purpose, architectural commitments,
  posture, the "no, you cannot do that" rules that guard against shortcuts.
  Slow-changing.
* `VISION.md` -- where the project is HEADING. Long-term capabilities, reframes,
  moon shots, ambitions that orient design without driving immediate work.
  Updated occasionally.

The three together form the knowledge layer, each with a distinct role and
update cadence: STATE every session, IDENTITY when the worldview shifts (rare),
VISION when reflection produces durable new ambitions (occasional). If a
project has IDENTITY but no VISION, that is fine; the reverse is a smell --
vision without grounded identity tends to drift, so add IDENTITY first.

The agent watches for the cues that justify introducing these (architectural
content bleeding into the STATE.md hot list, vision-shaped material accumulating
across working files) and proposes the lift when warranted. You can also
trigger it directly: "lift the architectural sections of STATE.md into a new
IDENTITY.md" or "we have enough vision-shaped material in `_working/`; create
VISION.md from it."


## What Goes Where

The agent handles routing automatically; this list is just for orientation if
you want to know where things end up.

* Findings, answered questions, decisions --> STATE.md (rewrite sections, update
  freshness markers, re-examine the Hot List). This is the default destination.
* Architectural commitments, posture, "do not do this" rules (when IDENTITY.md
  exists) --> IDENTITY.md
* Long-term ambitions, reframes, moon shots (when VISION.md exists) --> VISION.md
* In-workspace project layout (run / build / test commands for `impl/`,
  `android/`, etc.) --> a `## Layout` section in STATE.md, or section in
  IDENTITY.md if it exists
* Preliminary exploration, raw notes, chat dumps, session summaries, handoffs
  for future agents --> `_working/`
* Keyword index of working files --> `_working/INDEX.md` (agents maintain this
  automatically when they create or update working files; it lets future agents
  find relevant material without reading everything)
* Consumed working files --> `_archive/` (the user moves them; the agent
  surfaces which are absorbed and updates the INDEX). Or just delete.
* Rules the AI should always follow --> `.cursor/rules/`
* External codebase paths (when the workspace analyzes code that lives
  elsewhere) --> STATE.md (or IDENTITY.md when it exists)


## Relationship to Karpathy's "LLM Wiki" Pattern

Andrey Karpathy proposed (April 2026) an LLM-maintained wiki as a persistent
knowledge layer over raw source documents. His design and this template share the
same core conviction: stop reconstructing understanding from scratch every session,
and maintain a living knowledge artifact instead.

### What we share

* Persistent synthesis as the central artifact, not ephemeral chat.
* Raw sources kept separate from curated knowledge.
* A schema file (AGENTS.md) that governs how the LLM maintains the knowledge layer.
* Rewrite-in-place rather than append-only updates.
* Freshness tracking on sections.
* Proactive maintenance -- the agent flags staleness, contradictions, and drift.
* Plain markdown, inspectable and editable, version-controlled.

### Where we differ

* Karpathy uses a multi-page wiki with cross-linked entity, concept, and synthesis
  pages. We default to a single STATE.md, with optional IDENTITY.md and VISION.md
  as a fixed-size extension when a project's worldview and ambitions outgrow what
  STATE alone can hold. This avoids inter-page consistency problems and ontology
  drift at the cost of a natural ceiling on volume. Beyond three curated documents,
  the right move is to split into separate workspaces.
* Karpathy defines ingest as a first-class automated operation (new source arrives,
  LLM updates 10-15 pages). Our system is conversation-driven -- the human controls
  the pace. This trades systematic coverage for tighter editorial control, which
  matters when "sources" are live code analysis rather than static documents.
* We add a working-file layer (_working/) as a sanctioned messy staging area.
  Karpathy's design has no equivalent -- material goes straight into the wiki.
* We add a Hot List for rapid re-orientation. Karpathy has no equivalent.
* We add an explicit audit workflow (check contradictions, staleness, dead
  references). Karpathy's "lint" concept is similar but broader -- it also covers
  orphan pages and missing cross-links, which are multi-page wiki concerns.

### What we deliberately left out

* Formal page taxonomy (entity, concept, comparison pages) -- current LLMs already
  handle document granularity well without being told what page types exist.
  Imposing a taxonomy adds friction without solving a real problem at this scale.
* log.md as a changelog -- version control already provides history. A separate
  log file is maintenance overhead for information you rarely look at.
* Immutable/mutable document type distinction -- in practice the content itself
  signals what should and should not be rewritten (a meeting transcript vs. a
  synthesis). The formal distinction solves a problem that does not arise when a
  human controls the workflow.
* Multi-page wiki structure -- correct for large cross-domain knowledge bases,
  but trades the context-size problem for a harder context-selection problem
  (which of 500 pages need updating?). A single document eliminates update
  ambiguity entirely.
* Write-back from queries as an automatic workflow -- Karpathy says valuable
  answers should become wiki pages. Our agents are instructed to default to
  updating STATE.md with findings, which covers most of the same ground. The
  remaining gap (useful answers the user does not explicitly ask to save) could
  be addressed with a proactive suggestion, but has not caused problems in
  practice.

### If you outgrow this template

The natural evolution path if a single STATE.md becomes unwieldy:

* First, introduce IDENTITY.md and VISION.md as described in "Beyond STATE.md"
  above. This handles a deepening single project -- architectural identity and
  long-term ambitions get their own homes, and STATE.md returns to operational
  state only.
* If the workspace genuinely contains multiple projects, split into per-project
  STATE-<name>.md files (or per-project subdirectories with their own
  three-document knowledge layer). Add a top-level STATE.md that summarizes all
  projects (a few lines each). The agent reads the top-level state first, then
  loads the relevant project.

This gives bounded context per session without the multi-page consistency problem.
Beyond that, retrieval infrastructure (keyword search, semantic search) over the
curated knowledge layer becomes necessary regardless of organizational pattern.


## Design Principles

These explain why the template is shaped the way it is. Useful context for anyone
modifying or extending it.

### Structure over procedure

AGENTS.md tells the AI what the workspace looks like and what the authority rules
are, but not step-by-step how to perform every task. Current LLMs handle judgment
calls -- what to update, how to split a topic, what granularity to use -- well
enough that specifying procedures for these things adds friction without improving
results. If you find yourself wanting to add detailed procedural instructions,
consider whether the model already does the right thing without them.

### Bounded curated layer

The curated layer is bounded: STATE.md by default, with optional IDENTITY.md and
VISION.md as a fixed extension. Not a wiki. This eliminates the hardest problems
in multi-page systems: inter-page consistency, update ambiguity (which pages
need changing?), and ontology drift (page categories that blur over time). The
tradeoff is a natural ceiling on volume. One project per workspace, three
documents max in the curated layer. If it gets unwieldy, split into separate
workspaces. See "If you outgrow this template" for the next step beyond that.

The cap at three is deliberate. Two would be too few -- experience showed that
mixing operational state with architectural worldview in one document creates a
hot list that keeps growing past its limits and eventually obscures what is
actually hot. Four or more starts to recreate wiki-style consistency problems.
Three is the smallest split where each tier has a distinct role (operational,
binding, aspirational) and each has a distinct update cadence (continuous, rare,
occasional). Adding a fourth would require an equally clean role and cadence
distinction, which has not surfaced in practice.

### Knowledge persistence across sessions

Agent chats are typically ephemeral. They hit context limits, get abandoned,
and -- depending on the tool -- may not even live with the project files (some
tools store chat history on the host machine, so a project accessed from
multiple machines effectively starts each session from a blank slate). The
working-files layer (`_working/`) is the mechanism for getting knowledge out of
a chat and into the project before that happens, so understanding is never
trapped inside a single session.

This shifts the operational default. When an agent is unsure whether a finding
belongs in the curated layer, the right move is to drop a working file -- the
cost of a messy file that gets archived later is much smaller than the cost of
knowledge lost when the chat ends. The keyword index (`_working/INDEX.md`) is
what makes this work without future agents getting buried; every working file
lives behind a few keywords that future agents grep before reading anything.

Working files do not need to pass any durability test. Session summaries, debug
notes, ideas that may not pan out, and handoffs for future agents are all valid
even if they will be obsolete in a week. Anything worth not losing is worth a
working file.

### The AI is a maintainer, not a retriever

The template positions the AI's role as continuously maintaining a knowledge
artifact, not just answering questions from context. This is a deliberate framing
that affects behavior: agents default to updating STATE.md (or dropping a
working file when in doubt) rather than producing standalone answers that
evaporate when the chat ends.

### Tool compatibility

The core system is tool-agnostic. AGENTS.md is plain markdown that any LLM can
read. The tool-specific pieces are:

* `.cursor/rules/` -- Cursor auto-loads these into every chat. Other tools ignore
  them.
* `.cursor/skills/` -- Cursor's progressive disclosure system. The bootstrapping
  procedure lives here. Other tools reach it via the pointer in AGENTS.md.
* `CLAUDE.md` -- Claude reads this file by convention. It points to AGENTS.md.

To adapt this template to a different tool, add that tool's equivalent of
"always read AGENTS.md first" in whatever mechanism the tool provides.

### When to add skills vs. keep instructions in AGENTS.md

Instructions belong in AGENTS.md when they apply to most sessions and are short
enough that their context cost is negligible. Move something to a skill file when
it runs rarely (like bootstrapping -- once per project) and is long enough to
matter. A skill only saves context when the procedure behind it is substantially
larger than its description. Most knowledge-management workflows are judgment-based
and compress to a few lines, so they belong in AGENTS.md.

A specific case: STATE.md has a bootstrap skill (`bootstrap-workspace`) but
IDENTITY.md and VISION.md deliberately do not. STATE is universal and has rigid
structure -- a portable skeleton is meaningful. IDENTITY and VISION are introduced
selectively, with project-specific structure, so a skeleton would prescribe wrong
shapes. A skill would also create an invocation surface that nudges agents toward
creating these files prematurely, defeating the earned-over-time model. Their
introduction is conversational instead, with the rule documented in AGENTS.md.


## Tips

* Back up your workspace folder periodically. Cursor stores chat transcripts in
  your home directory (`%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\projects\`), not in the workspace.
  If you want to preserve chat history too, back up that location as well.
* The `_archive/` folder is optional. If you are comfortable deleting consumed
  working files, skip it. It exists for people who are not ready to let go yet.
* For meetings and interviews, keep the full transcript in `_archive/` and a
  shorter summary in `_working/`. The summary is what agents will find via the
  index and use day-to-day. The full transcript stays available in case you need
  to look up a specific quote, exact wording, or a detail the summary missed.
